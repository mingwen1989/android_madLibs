# [Android Mad Libs](https://github.com/themingfu/android_madLibs)

Have you ever played Mad Libs? Mad Libs are silly stories with some of the words missing. Without looking at the story, you are prompted to fill out a list of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Then, copy them onto another piece of paper that contains a story, missing those crucial words that you are now providing. The idea is to pick bizarre words without knowing what the story is, and then when you fill them in the results can be hilarious.

This is an app that allows the user to play Mad Libs. The user provides three words (a noun, a verb, and an adjective) which are combined to form a hilarious amalgam.
